## Objective

To evaluate the utilization of dexmedetomidine in intensive care units across Memorial Hermann Health System in regards to indication, patient outcomes and patient safety. 

## Background

Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) is an intravenous centrally-acting selective alpha-2 receptor agonist. It is approved for ICU sedation of initially intubated, mechanically ventilated patients and for procedural use in non-intubated patients. The FDA approved dosing range is 0.2-0.7mcg/kg/hr, but doses up to 1.5mcg/kg/hr has been studied that showed safety with higher incidences of sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, dexmedetomidine has been shown to result in more days alive without delirium or coma and less time on the ventilator with comparable sedation levels achieved compared to benzodiazepine infusion. In a cost analysis trial, dexmedetomidine resulted in significantly lower total ICU costs primarily driven by the decrease in mechanical ventilation costs and length of ICU stay costs.

The goal of this MUE is to compare the utilization of dexmedetomidine in intensive care units across the Memorial Hermann health system and identify if our current use of dexmedetomidine is decreasing the total ICU costs. 

## Design

* Inclusion: all ICU patients who received dexmedetomidine 
* Exclusion: Age < 18 years old 
* Time frame: FY 2015
